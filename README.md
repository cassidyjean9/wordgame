An open source word game based on wordle


This is a project I threw together in a weekend. Its a wordle clone written in the Unity Game engine. It takes the wordle gameplay and allows you to play it multiple times per day with a random word instead of a shared word based on time. I have tested it on Windows and Android and will host builds of the game on [my itch](https://josfeld.itch.io/word-game)
